# Chapter 7

In this chapter you learn the basics about rotation, quaternions, and splines.
* Using Euler angles for the rotation of a box
* Using a quaternion for the rotation of a box
* Avoiding a gimbal lock with relative rotation
* Exploring Spherical Linear Interpolation (SLERP) for the quaternion
* Using a Cubic Hermite Spline to move objects along a curve
